Classes from `dart:ui` that run on pure Dart.
Eliminates the error _"Dart library 'dart:ui' is not available on this platform"_.
You can now quickly run a third-party package with Flutter dependencies on the server side or CLI.
Feel free to use it in your awesome project.

_If you write an article about **PureDartUi** or any of [these](https://pub.dev/packages?q=publisher%3Asyrokomskyi.com&sort=updated) packages, let me know and I'll post the URL of the article in the **README**_ ü§ù

## üî• Motivation

Sometimes we want to use nice packages from pub.dev on the CLI or server side.
But (sometimes) the needed package has dependencies on Flutter...

I created `pure_dart_ui` to address this injustice in a single line (see `Usage` section below).

## üåü Features

### Classes independed of the Flutter SDK

- `Color`
- `Offset`
- `Rect`
- `Size`

### Functions independed of the Flutter SDK

- `clampDouble`
- `lerpDouble`

## üöÄ Usage

Add the package `pure_dart_ui` to `pubspec.yaml` and import the library:

```dart
import 'package:pure_dart_ui/pure_dart_ui.dart';
```

Or, if you want to fix the error stream when you run `dart main.dart`, then replace the line

```dart
// replace this import and be happy
import 'dart:ui';
```

with the line above in the desired 3rd-party package.

Use the classes and functions in this package same way you used `Flutter dart:ui`.

In other words, you can create your own application or use a 3rd-party package with [dart:ui features](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/dart-ui-library.html) based on a pure Dart, without depending on the Flutter SDK.

### Use `Color`

```dart
const color = Color(0xffa1b2c3);
```

## ‚úÖ TODO (perhaps)

Once you start using the **PureDartUi**, it will become easy to choose the functionality to contribute. But if you already get everything you need from this package but have some free time, let me write here what I have planned:

- Documenting the undocumented. Whenever you come across a class, property, or method within our codebase that you're familiar with and notice it lacks documentation, kindly spare a couple of minutes to jot down some helpful notes for your fellow developers.
- Refining the code. While I'm aware it's primarily my responsibility to refactor the code, I wholeheartedly welcome any contributions you're willing to make in this area. Your insights and improvements are appreciated!
- Constructive code reviews. Should you discover a more efficient approach to achieve something, I'm all ears. Your suggestions for enhancement are invaluable.

- Fix typos/grammar mistakes.
- Report bugs and scenarios that are difficult to implement.
- Implement new features by making a pull-request.

It's just a habit of mine: writing down ideas that come to mind while working on a project. I confess that I rarely return to these notes. But now, hopefully, even if you don't have an idea yet, the above notes will help you choose the suitable "feature" and become a contributor to the open-source community.
