# Pure Dart UI

Some classes from `dart.ui` that run on pure Dart.

- Color
- Offset
- Rect
- Size

- clampDouble
- lerpDouble()

## Getting started

Add this package to `pubspec.yaml`.

## Usage

Use the classes in this package same way you used `Flutter dart:ui`.

You can create your own application with [dart:ui](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/dart-ui-library.html) power on pure Dart, without depending on the Flutter SDK.
